# HOWARD CHEN

## BIOGRAPHY

My name is Howard Chen and I live in a small town in Virginia called Roanoke. Roanoke is a great mountain town nestled in a valley
of the Appalachian mountains. I am in my first year of marriage and we have a chocolate lab named Boone.  We love the outdoors and 
Roanoke offers great mountain biking, road biking, kayaking, canoing, hunting, fishing, rock climbing, bouldering, and the 
Appalachian Trail is right in our backyard. I moved here in 2007 after I graduated from Virginia Tech (which is only a 30 minute
drive from roanoke). 

Virginia Tech is where I received my first Bachelor of Science degree. That degree was in Industrial Design in the School of 
Architecture and Design. For a period of my life, I worked for a startup company called Levelvision. Levelvision produced floor 
mats that had lcd screens built into them. I was their ‘Content, Technology, and Design Specialist.’ The company was sold and I
wanted to pursue a career in photography. I jumped head first into photography, but I am also a licensed contractor, and do design
projects on the side. It kept me busy, but work became more and more inconsistent. Thus, I decided to pursue a career in Computer
Science. I’m itching to learn and excited to combine the fields of CS and product design.

My hobbies include photography, biking, hiking, fishing, motorcycling, and weight lifting.
